Welcome to Bismuth, a digital distributed self-regulating database system whose primary application is currency, 
and its first application is mining. Bismuth is not based on code of BTC or any of it's derivates, it is only inspired
by some ideas laid down by Satoshi Nakamoto (BitCoin), SunnyKing (PeerCoin), John Connor (vCash), and NXT developers.
