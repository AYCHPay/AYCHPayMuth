Welcome to Bismuth, a digital distributed self-regulating database system whose primary application is currency, 
and its first application is mining. Bismuth is not based on code of BTC or any of it's derivates, it is only inspired
by some ideas laid down by Satoshi Nakamoto (BitCoin), SunnyKing (PeerCoin), John Connor (vCash), and NXT and ETH developers.

Bismuth does not draw any code from other repositories, instead it reformulates the cryptocurrency code to be easily readable,
compatible across all platforms, integrated into business solutions with utmost ease and most importantly open for development
to wide public through it's simplicity, while minimizing the security risk of custom code implementations.

Bismuth vastly differs from the mentioned systems in many ways and some concepts are very different, in pursuit of improved
performance and removal of deliberate, non-technical limitations like the block size. In fact, Bismuth does not differ
between a block and a transactions, those are synonymous here. This means that coins can be spend instantly, because
the transaction time is equal to zero + technical limitations of the network. The risk of network overload resulting from this
feature is eliminated by flexible fees. With the growiing network usage, the fees also rise. However when the network is not
used extensively, fees are almost non-existent. The fees are currently burned, to stimulate energy expenditure in real-life systems
and eliminate issues associated with POS systems (hoarding).
