New rollback proposal, which reworks sync entirely:

txhash invalid - 



i = 0
while not synced:
	node sends hash-i to client
		if client knows the hash, it sends all following txs to the node
			node verifies the incoming txs and saves them to the local database, deletes own followups
			synced = True
	
		if client does not know the hash, it sends it's hash-i to node
			node finds client's hash-i in the database and sends all newer blocks
				client verifies the blocks and saves them to local database, deletes own followups
				synced = True

OLD:
the process happens during the ledger synchronization phase
when the txhash is invalid, the client and node enter a subloop
client requests i-1 (lower than the latest received) transaction
and seeks the hash received
