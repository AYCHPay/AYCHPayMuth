New rollback proposal, which reworks sync entirely:


txhash invalid - 
node sends latest hash to client
	if client knows the hash, it sends all following txs to the node
		node verifies the incoming txs and saves them to the local database

	if client does not know the hash, it sends it's latest hash to node
		node finds client's latest hash in the database and sends all newer blocks
			client verifies the blocks and saves them to local database

OLD:
the process happens during the ledger synchronization phase
when the txhash is invalid, the client and node enter a subloop
client requests i-1 (lower than the latest received) transaction
and seeks the hash received
