Select timestamp of the (current block -50) from the ledger
Calculate how much time has passed since that timestamp, the longer, the lower the transaction
Fee =1/(timestamp_current - timestamp_50)
Fee is added to the ledger as an extra column, verified by every node's mempool

constant = 1

current time: 12:30
time before 50 txs: 12:15
1/0,25(h) = 4 fee

current time: 12:30
time before 50 txs: 11:30
1/1(h) = 1 fee
